# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

This simple Python application allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using a XOR-based encryption technique. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter.

## Features

- **Encrypt Image**: Select an image file (currently supports .jpg and .jpeg formats), enter a numeric key, and encrypt the image file.
- **Decrypt Image**: Select an encrypted image file, enter the same numeric key used for encryption, and decrypt the image file.
- **GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for file selection and key input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually included in standard Python distributions)
- Pillow library (for future versions that include image preview or manipulation)
